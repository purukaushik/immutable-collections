# immutable-collections
The idea behind this project is to recreate most of the general `java.util.Collection` like abstract data types, ala `List`, `Map`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Stack` and make them immutable by dfault.

Almost all implementations provided are to be thread safe by default.

Currently this project is wip. Feel free to contribute your implementations and send me a PR.
